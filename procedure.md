### Procedure

1. **Enter the Function**
   Select or type the desired mathematical function in the input box under “Function f(x)”.

2. **Set the Integration Limits**
   Provide the lower limit (a) and upper limit (b) within which the area under the curve will be calculated.

3. **Choose the Number of Segments**
   Specify the number of segments to divide the interval into. A higher number of segments generally increases accuracy.

4. **Select the Numerical Integration Method**
   Choose between Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson’s Rule from the integration method dropdown menu.

5. **Simulate the Integration**
   Click on the “Simulate” button to compute the approximate integral value.

6. **View the Numerical Result**
   The calculated value of the integral will be displayed on the right side under the “Result” section.

7. **Analyze the Graph**
   Observe the shaded region under the function plot to visually interpret the area being approximated.

8. **Compare Method Accuracy (Optional)**
   Repeat the experiment using a different method or a different number of segments to analyze the change in accuracy.

Numerical integration is a technique used to estimate the area under a curve, especially when finding the exact integral is difficult or impossible. It involves dividing the curve into smaller sections and summing the areas of these sections to approximate the total area.

Two popular methods are:

Trapezoidal Rule: This method divides the area into trapezoids and calculates their combined area.
Simpson's Rule: This method approximates the area using parabolic arcs for greater accuracy.
Both methods are commonly used in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and data science, to solve real-world problems where exact solutions are impractical.

### Aim

The aim of this experiment is to understand and evaluate numerical integration techniques using a simulation tool by performing the following steps:

1. To input a mathematical function and define appropriate lower and upper integration limits.
2. To divide the given interval into a specific number of segments for numerical computation.
3. To apply different numerical integration methods such as:
   - Trapezoidal Rule
   - Simpson’s Methods 
4. To compute the approximate area under the curve of the given function within the specified limits.
5. To visually analyze the shaded region under the plotted function graph to relate the numerical result with the actual function behavior.
6. To compare the accuracy of different integration techniques by varying the number of segments and observing the impact on the result.
7. To develop an understanding of how numerical integration supports problem-solving when analytical integration is difficult or impossible.

### About the Experiment  

This experiment is designed to study numerical integration techniques used to approximate definite integrals when analytical integration is difficult or impossible. The focus is on the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson’s 1/3 and 3/8 Rules, which provide effective ways to estimate the area under a curve using discrete data points. Students learn how these methods work for evenly spaced intervals, analyze the error bounds associated with each approach, and compare their accuracy. Numerical integration plays a key role in scientific computing, particularly in engineering and physics applications where complex functions or experimental data must be integrated.
